# Reference Generator - Dynamics CRM

## Important Note

After reviewing synchronous workflows in CRM 2013+ I feel this offers a solution that makes this project somewhat redundant. I may investigate expanding this to work using synchronous workflows at a later stage so I will just put this on hold for now.

## Synopsis

A common piece of development many people embark on during their Dynamics CRM development career is auto numbering.  There is always something a little custom on how we want to generate the number including the use of a prefix and/or suffix.  And thus this project was born.
